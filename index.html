                    <h3>Recipe</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a bowl, combine the milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda. Add ghee and mix well until the mixture becomes crumbly. Slowly add milk, little by little, and knead into a soft, smooth dough. If the dough is sticky, add a tiny bit more milk powder; if it's dry, add a bit more milk. Let the dough rest for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Grease your hands with a little ghee or oil. Divide the dough into small, smooth balls, about the size of a marble. Ensure there are no cracks on the surface, as cracks may cause the jamuns to break while frying.</li>
                        <li>In a pan, add sugar and water. Stir to dissolve the sugar and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer for 5-7 minutes. Add cardamom pods and saffron, if using, and remove from heat. Let the syrup cool slightly.</li>
                        <li>Heat ghee or oil in a deep frying pan on low-medium heat. Fry the gulab jamuns in batches, ensuring the oil is not too hot, as high heat can cook them unevenly. Gently drop the balls into the oil and fry them, stirring occasionally, until they are golden brown and puffed up (this can take 7-10 minutes).</li>
                        <li>Once done, remove them from the oil and immediately immerse them in the warm sugar syrup. Let the gulab jamun soak for at least 30 minutes before serving.</li>
                        <p>Enjoy your homemade, melt-in-your-mouth gulab jamuns!</p>
